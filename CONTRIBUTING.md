# Contributing to Dead Drop

At this moment this is a pet project and not really thought out a lot,
it may not be that active. I really appreciate any contribution.

## The objective of dead drop

The main objective of dead drop is to have a place where you can dial
through a phone and listen to a random message or record your own.

## How to contribute

Above All: Be nice, always.

* Ensure the linter shows no warnings or errors
* Don't break the CI
* Make the PRs according to [Git Flow][gitflow]: (features go to
  develop, hotfixes go to master)
